# Big-Data-and-Machine-Learning

Here lies different code that was written by me (Thomas Tasioulis) and University Staff members in Swansea University.

Code is in python and in some cases it is followed by respective reports that were written to underpin the existing code.

Under no circumstances do I completely own the rights for this code.
 
The writer does not have any responsibility for any usage that does not follow the principles of academic integrity and/or lies under academic misconduct rules.

#### Feel free to explore.

This is a Grumpy project :))
